Static Website: A Static Website (sometimes called a flat or stationary page) is displayed in a web browser exactly as it is stored. It contains web pages with fixed content coded in HTML and stored on a web server. It does not change, it stays the same, or "static" for every viewer of the site.

Dynamic Website: A Dynamic Website (also referred to as a database-driven site) requires web programming and database design. A dynamic website contains information and content that changes, depending on factors such as the viewer of the site, the time of the day, the time zone, or the native language of the country the viewer). The content of your site (text/images) is stored on a database or content management system. When the information is updated or changed within the database, it changes on the site.
